# Coffee Delivery

A very interesting challenge that I developed during my journey in the #ignite course on the #reactjs track! 😀

In this application, users can view all available coffees and add them to the cart with the desired quantity. After adding items to the cart, users will fill out a form with their address and payment method. Then, they just need to confirm the order! ☕

Additionally, I made the necessary adjustments to adapt the application for different devices. 📱🖥️

The following tools were used for the development of this application:

Styled Components ✅ <br/>
React-router-dom ✅ <br/>
React-hook-form with zod ✅ <br/>
Contexts ✅ <br/>
Immer ✅
